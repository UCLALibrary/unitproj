    <H4>(1) VOLUME NUMBERS </H4>
    
    <P>All volumes of a monographic set are to be marked with correct volume
      numbers, beginning with the first as v. 1. Volume designations should be
      translated into English (never use the vernacular). </P>

    <H4>(2) COPIES </H4>
    
    <P>For those libraries which have adopted the ORION circulation module, the
      unique identifier for copies is the barcode. For those libraries which are
      not yet using the ORION circulation module, copy 2, etc. of the same work
      are uniquely identified by adding cop. 2, etc. to the end of the call
      number. Cop. 1 is never used. </P>

    <H4>(3) ABBREVIATIONS TO BE USED IN CALL NUMBERS (CATALOGING DEPT.
    PRACTICE) </H4>
    
    <P>LC uses the standard list of appreviations as provided in AACR2 for call
      numbers, e.g., vol. or supp. <B>Do not use these abbreviations in call
      numbers</B>; instead, use the Cataloging Department

    <H3>DOUBLE CUTTER NUMBERS </H3>
    
    <P>Double cutter numbers are used in call numbers as shown in the
      classification schedules for specific purposes. In many respects the
      construction of a double cutter number is an extension of the
      classification process. <STRONG>For cuttering in music scores and belles
      lettres, consult <A HREF="callpt31.htm"><CITE>Local Call Numbers.</CITE></A></STRONG></P>
    
    <P><A NAME="topcut"></A></P>
    
    <H4>(1) TOPICAL DOUBLE CUTTER NUMBERS </H4>
    
    <P>Sometimes the first number is &quot;topical,&quot; that is, it indicates
      a specific subject and is printed in the schedule as part of the class
      number. The second cutter number is usually derived from the main entry
      and usually consists of a capital letter followed by two digits. Both the
      first and the second cutter numbers are read decimally (i.e., both cutter
      numbers may be expanded decimally). If LC hasn't assigned a topic, expand
      the first cutter decimally. </P>
    
    <P>When the second cutter number is for a heading or title which begins
      with numeric rather than alphabetic characters (e.g., <CITE>1976: The
      Bicentennial</CITE>), construct the number so that it will file before any
      other work with the same classification and first cutter number. This
      means the second cutter will begin with the letter &quot;A&quot; and its
      expanded numbers will place it before any alphabetic title cuttered to &quot;A&quot;
      in the shelflist. (See the <CITE>Subject Cataloging Manual, Shelflisting</CITE>,
      G 060, p. 27.) </P>
    
    <P>If both cutters are topical, additional digits are used to distinguish
      between different main entries in LC cutter numbers:</P>

    <H4>(2) COUNTRY OR REGION DOUBLE CUTTER NUMBERS </H4>
    
    <P>Double cuttering is used throughout the LC Classification schedules in
      order to group works by geographical area. Use the cutter tables of
      regions and countries from the <CITE>Subject Cataloging Manual,
      Shelflisting</CITE> (G 300, pages 4-9) unless other provisions have been
      specified. A copy of this table is posted in the Cataloging Department
      shelflist area. Cutters are assigned from A3-Z.</P>
    
    <P>In certain classification areas specific provisions are made for
      geographical cuttering. One example of this kind of table is in <STRONG>HD</STRONG>
      in the section for <CITE>Industries and Trades.</CITE> Under <CITE>Table
      C,</CITE> the subdivision is: </P>

    <H4>(3) BIOGRAPHICAL DOUBLE CUTTER NUMBERS </H4>
    
    <P>The second cutter in some cases may represent Library of Congress
      biography tables. Works classed in individual biography numbers are always
      further subarranged in accordance with an appropriate biography table. If
      such a table is not provided in the particular schedule (such as the
      individual biography tables of <CITE>Class D</CITE> or the artist table
      of <CITE>Class N</CITE>), the following general table is used: </P>
    
    <H5>BIOGRAPHY TABLE (G 320, pp. 5-7) </H5>

<PRE>
      .x          Cutter for the individual 
      .xA2        Collected works.  By date 
      .xA25       Selected works.  Selections.  By date. 
                       Including quotations. 
      .xA3        Autobiography, diaries, etc.  By title. 
      .xA4          Letters.  By date. 
      .xA5        Speeches, essays, and lectures.  By date. 
                       Including interviews. 
      .xA6-Z*     Individual biography, interviews and criticism. 
                       By main entry. 
                       Including criticism of selected works, 
                       autobiography, quotations, letters, 
                       speeches, interviews, etc. 
</PRE>
    
    <P>* If the main entry of a biographical or critical work begins with &quot;A&quot;
      and the work is classed in a biography class, do not cutter lower than A6.
      The suggested cutters for entries beginning with &quot;A&quot; are: </P>

<PRE>
                        Aa-Af A6-A699 
                        Ag-Al A7-A799 
                        Am-Ar A8-A899 
                        As-Az A9-A999 
</PRE>
    
    <P>Unless the schedule makes special provision, the numbers for Collected
      works, Selected works, and Speeches, essays, and lectures are very seldom
      used, since collections of this kind are normally classed with the topic.
      Without special provisions, assign these numbers only when the collection
      by the individual biographee is so general that no specific topic can be
      identified and the work would otherwise be classed in A.</P>
    
    <P>Biography tables normally provide for the assignment of two cutters in
      the formulation of the call number. Assign the first cutter for the
      subject of the work, i.e., the name of the person indicated in the first
      subject added entry of the individual record. Assign the second cutter
      according to the provisions of the number and caption selected from the
      preceding Biography table. For example, if the work is to be classed under
      Biography and criticism, assign as the second cutter a cutter based on the
      main entry heading of the work. Never apply a biography table to any
      biography classed in a General works number, especially if the note there
      states &quot;Including biography.&quot; </P>
    
    <P><A NAME="trans"></A></P>
    
    <H3>TRANSLATIONS </H3>
    
    <P>Use the translation table only when the main entry is a personal author
      or title. Do not use for corporate or conference main entries. Consult the
      <CITE>Subject Cataloging Manual, Shelflisting</CITE>, G 220. </P>
    
    <P>Translations generally follow the original work alphabetically by
      language. They are distinguished from the original by adding digits
      representing a language from the LC translation table to the number of the
      original work: </P>
    
    <P><A NAME="transtab"></A></P>
    
    <H4>TRANSLATION TABLE </H4>

                  .x13        English translation 
                  .x14        French translation 
                  .x15        German translation 
                  .x16        Italian translation 
                  .x17        Russian translation 
                  .x18        Spanish translation 
</PRE>
    
    <P>If there is a special place indicated for translations in the Master set
      of the LC classification tables, follow it. </P>
    
    <P>The languages most likely to be used are listed in the above table. If a
      language is not listed, insert it in alphabetical order by cutter. </P>

<PRE>
      Example:    Cutter for the original work    L35 
                  Polyglot                        L3512 
                  Czech translation               L35125 
                  English translation             L3513 
                  Portuguese translation          L35168 
                  Russian translation             L3517 
</PRE>
    
    <P>In the table, note that the digit &quot;1&quot; is inserted between the
      number for the work in the original language and the number for the
      language of the translation (3 = English, 4 = French, 5 = German, etc.).
      This is done to insure that translations directly follow the original;
      other works in close alphabetical order will follow all of the
      translations, because the digit &quot;1&quot; is not used for normal
      cuttering. </P>
    
    <P><A NAME="documents"></A></P>
    
    <H3>DOCUMENTS </H3>
    
    <P>For cuttering official documents issued by jurisdictions and/or their
      subordinate corporate bodies, see the instructions in Section G 220, pages
      4 and 5 of the <CITE>Subject Cataloging Manual, Shelflisting</CITE>.
      These instructions provide for the cataloger to give government agencies
      their own cutter number when constructing the call number. </P>
    
    <P>Until the late 1960's, LC (and the Cataloging Department) used &quot;A&quot;
      when constructing a cutter number for a publication issued by a governing
      body of a country, city, etc. for which the class or cutter number stood.
      The purpose of this practice was to place document material at the
      beginning of the number for each such governing body, since government
      agencies were not given their own cutter numbers. Now that they are given
      their own cutter numbers, the practice of using the &quot;A&quot;
      cuttering is unnecessary. However, if you encounter this practice on older
      LC cataloging, <B>accept the LC call number unless there is a conflict.</B>
    </P>
    
    <P><A NAME="congresses"></A></P>
    
    <H3>CONGRESSES AND CONFERENCES </H3>
    
    <P>Congresses, conferences, festivals, etc. are generally arranged
      alphabetically by name, then chronologically by year the session was held,
      not year of publication. See the <CITE>Subject Cataloging Manual,
      Shelfisting</CITE>, Section G 230 for more details. LC formerly added
      lower case letters to the date, with each letter or combination
      representing a category. When using LC copy, accept the LC call number as
      given on the record. </P>
