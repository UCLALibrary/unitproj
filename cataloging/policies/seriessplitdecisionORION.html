            <h1>Series Split Tracing Decision Records</h1>
            <h3>August 2000</h3>
            <p><b>Note: </b>This policy affects &quot;fts&quot; vs. &quot;fns&quot; 
              decisions only.</p>
            <p><b>HISTORY: </b>In the past, YRL Cataloging often decided not to 
              trace certain types of series, even when the national authority 
              record said to trace them. However, more recently, YRL's policy 
              has been to follow national standards whenever possible. Furthermore, 
              because it was impossible to have two 645 fields co-existing in 
              an ORION1 series authority record, all Cataloging Units had to adhere 
              to the same series tracing decision. When more than one unit used 
              the same series, the Cataloging Units indicated this with a code 
              in the 644 or 646 (ex.: $5 BI,UR). </p>
            <p>In ORION2, it is now possible to have <b>series split decision 
              records</b> (series with multiple 645s). This is the method whereby 
              YRL hopes to redress the issue of making all of its series--including 
              those where YRL took a historically alternative position on the 
              tracing--follow national standards.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> 1) If there is both an OCLC and an ORION2 authority record, 
                and the <b>tracing differs</b> (one record has 645 "n" and the 
                other 645 "t"), <b>use the tracing reflected in the OCLC authority 
                record on the bibliographic record. In most cases, the earlier 
                YRL Cataloging decision would have been not to trace a series, 
                where the national standard was to trace it.</b> </p>
              <p> 2) Make printouts of the OCLC and ORION2 authority records. 
                On the ORION2 authority record printout, write the following information, 
                with the most recent decision listed first:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>645 t $d for works cataloged after MM/YY</b> (fill in the 
                  appropriate month, year) <b>$5 UR</b></li>
                <li> <b>645 n $d represents earlier UCLA decision $5 UR</b></li>
                <li> In rare cases, the existing ORION2 record may be traced, 
                  and the OCLC authority record not traced, so the above information 
                  will appear instead as: </li>
                <li>645 n $d for works cataloged after MM/YY $5 UR </li>
                <li>645 t $d represents earlier UCLA decision $5 UR</li>
                <li> Submit the printouts for both the OCLC and the ORION2 authority 
                  records to the Authority Section, attached to a completed <a href="http://www.library.ucla.edu/libraries/cataloging/authority/conflictform.pdf">"ORION 
                  Conflict Report" (pdf)</a>. The Authority Section will give 
                  these edits high priority, and will revise ORION2 as quickly 
                  as possible.</li>
              </ol>
              <p> 3) <b>NOTE: Any potential split-decision records involving another 
                Cataloging Unit need to be referred to the YRL Dept. Head, who 
                will consult with the appropriate Unit(s) for a final agreement.</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li> If a decision is reached to retain the local tracing, the 
                  following will be added to the authority record: <br />
                  <b>667 UCLA decision not to follow national standard, [initials] 
                  MM/YY</b></li>
              </ul>
              <p>4) <b>NOTE: What to do if the OCLC authority record already has 
                a split decision in it (multiple 645s already exist): </b></p>
              <ol>
                <li> <b>These records will not be loaded into ORION2 as is; further 
                  decisions regarding tracing will need to be made</b></li>
                <li><b>In most cases, trace the series. Cross out the line with 
                  "645 n"; keep the line with "645 t" (the current national standard 
                  is to trace most series) </b></li>
                <li>When in doubt, consult with a supervisor, the Head of Cataloging, 
                  or another appropriate person.</li>
              </ol>
