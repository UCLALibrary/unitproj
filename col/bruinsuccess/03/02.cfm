<h2>In the News</h2>

<p>
A well-known historian was recently involved in a big plagiarism scandal. After receiving her PhD from Harvard University, she enjoyed a successful career teaching, publishing, making regular television appearances and more. She even won a Pulitzer Prize in 1995. So what happened? It was discovered that large passages of her book were taken from an earlier work by someone else&mdash;with no attributions to the original source. Faced with accusations of plagiarism, the publisher settled with the author of the original work out of court. 
</p>
<p>
Her excuse? Oops&mdash;she says she got her notes mixed up and confused direct quotes from outside sources for her own thoughts. 
</p>
<p>
Her reputation as an historian and award-winning author was tarnished forever.
