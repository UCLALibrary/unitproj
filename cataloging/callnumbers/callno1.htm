    <H3>GENERAL CALL NUMBER POLICY</H3>
    
    <P><A NAME="gen"></A></P>
    
    <H3>General Guidelines</H3>
    
    <P> When assigning a call number, apply the Library of Congress
      classification schedules and cuttering tables, based on how the item best
      fits into the collection. When creating an original call number, use the
      LC cutter tables. When using LC copy, use the LC call number as given
      unless it is an obvious error or it conflicts with a call number already
      assigned. When using contributed library copy, use the LC classification
      number unless it is an obvious error, verify the cutter number with the LC
      cutter table, and adjust it accordingly. Exceptions to these general
      guidelines are listed below.</P>
    
    <P> In 1980, after many years of using the Cutter and Cutter/Sanborn
      cuttering tables exclusively, the UCLA Library Cataloging Centers adopted
      the use of the Library of Congress cuttering table for the majority of
      situations. The superimposition of LC's cuttering upon our local practice
      disrupts the alphabetical arrangement by main entry within a particular
      classification number; therefore, it was decided to continue the local
      practice in certain situations in which it was felt that a continuing
      alphabetical arrangement was essential. </P>
    
    <P><A NAME="exc"></A></P>
    
    <H4>EXCEPTIONS TO LC PRACTICE</H4>
    
    <P> These are the ten situations in which we will still use UCLA's original
      cuttering scheme.</P>
    
    <P> When assigning call numbers to items being added to the UCLA Library
      collections, follow the Library of Congress classification and/or
      cuttering practices in all classification areas, EXCEPT those listed
      below:</P>
    <OL>
      <LI> Belles lettres in the P-PZ classification for authors who have a
        single classification or cutter number (for others, follow the LC
        classification tables and use Cutter-Sanborn tables).</LI>
      <LI> California cities classed in F 869.</LI>
      <LI> Music scores classed in M.</LI>
      <LI> Literary bibliographies, which are classed with the author's belles
        lettres number in P.</LI>
      <LI> Individual artists and/or their works of art classed in N. In
        addition to using locally established cutters for the artist, also
        consistently apply the local cutter table for the range of numbers in
        Table 5, xA6-x79 (see <A NAME="apxb">Appendix &quot;B&quot;</A>).</LI>
      <LI> LC classification numbers reserved or modified for local use, such
        as TR 16 or Z 233 M3 (Special Collections), LD 791.8-791.9 (UCLA
        dissertations), and N 7433.4, Artists' books. See Cataloging Dept.
        Reserved or Modified Call Numbers (<A NAME="apxa">Appendix &quot;</A>)
        for a complete listing and explanation.</LI>
      <LI> Serials that are continuations of others. These will usually retain
        the call number of the earlier title providing that the volume
        designation does not begin again with the number &quot;1&quot;.</LI>
      <LI> Series, which are classed together or separately as a local
        decision. For example, if we have decided to class items of a
        monographic series together and the Library of Congress gives each item
        a separate call number, we will continue to assign our classification
        number to each item in the series until the title of the series changes
        or upon a series change request from a non-cataloging unit, at which
        time the treatment of the series will be re-examined.</LI>
      <LI> Standing requests from individual non-cataloging units who desire
        local cuttering so that certain areas of their collections (usually
        literary or &quot;author-like&quot; sequences) remain in alphabetical
        order. Specific areas that fall under this category are: photographers
        classed in TR, screenplays classed in PN 1997, and composers classed in
        ML 410.</LI>
      <LI> Specific requests from non-cataloging units. These appear at the top
        of the workform through a note in the 946 field. Public service units
        and/or collection development staff notify Cataloging in this way when
        they wish to keep the new work together with a previously cataloged
        edition or translation or with a locally assigned biographical, topical
        or geographic cutter, or when they wish to suggest other exceptional
        classification treatment.</LI>
    </OL>
    
    <P> For materials in the ten exceptional categories listed above, strive
      for aphabetical order in the shelflist and apply UCLA's local cuttering
      practices as detailed in <A HREF="callpt31.htm">CALL NUMBERS III (Local
        Call Numbers)</A>.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="err"></A></P>
    
    <H4>ERRONEOUS CLASS NUMBERS </H4>
    
    <P> If you suspect that the classification number is erroneous, consult the
      shelflist, or, if comparison is not possible in the shelflist, consult the
      master set of classification schedules. However, accept LC call numbers on
      older records even if the classification schedules have changed (e.g.,
      Buddhism is now BQ instead of BL), or if LC's cuttering practice has
      changed (e.g., LC formerly used work marks for conference proceedings).</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="conf"></A></P>
    
    <H4>CONFLICTING CALL NUMBERS </H4>
    
    <P> A call number does not conflict unless it matches a number already in
      the shelflist exactly, including the work mark. Adjust the cutter number
      of the work in hand to resolve the conflict. See the sections describing
      call number construction practice for both LC classification (CALL NUMBERS
      II, pages 8-9) and our <A HREF="callpt31.htm#localcut">local cuttering</A>
      (CALL NUMBERS III, page 2).</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="recsl"></A></P>
    
    <H4>RECORDING CALL NUMBER IN SHELFLIST</H4>
    
    <P> Record the final call number on the portion of the workform labeled
      TEMP SL, or, lacking a workform, on a 3 x 5 card annotated with basic
      bibliographic information. File this temporary shelflist card in the
      appropriate location for that call number in the shelflist. This will
      reserve that number.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="phys"></A></P>
    
    <H4>PHYSICAL PLACEMENT OF CALL NUMBER IN WORK</H4>
    
    <P>Print the full call number for each item (including branch stamp if the
      item is for a branch) on the recto of the page after the title page unless
      that page is a plate. If it is a plate, print the call number on the verso
      of the title page. Print the capital letter(s) representing the major
      classification area on the first line, the Arabic numeral(s) for the more
      specific subject on the second line, and other call number element(s) on
      subsequent lines. The call number should be printed approximately 1/2 to
      3/4 of an inch from the top of the page, close to the center of the page.
      If this location cannot be used, place the call number to the side where
      space is available. Use a label if the paper is brittle or if it is
      necessary for visibility.</P>
    
    <P>On UCLA theses, place the call number on the page after the approval
      page. For music scores and parts, follow special rules on proper labeling
      of the scores and parts. (Refer to Music Cataloging Manual for specific
      directions.) Record call numbers for microforms and other non-print
      materials on slips and include them with the materials so that Records
      Management staff may label the items correctly.</P>

    <H4>VOLUME DESIGNATION GUIDE</H4>
    
    <P> In some cases, UCLA's standard abbreviations for volume label
      designations do NOT correspond with those of LC (which are from AACR2,
      Appendix B). For abbreviations to be used in call numbers, use the
      following list:</P>

    <H4>SIZE DESIGNATION GUIDE</H4>
    
    <P> Since size of the book may determine its location in the stacks, call
      numbers have size marks added according to the following guidelines:</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="sizgen"></A></P>
    
    <H5>GENERAL POLICY</H5>

<PRE>
         *  over call number if book is more than 29 through 38
            cm. high or more than 30 cm. in width.

            cm. high.
       ***  over call number if book is more than 61 cm. high.
      Min.  over call number if book is less than 14 cm. high.
</PRE>
    
    <P>For monographic sets, mark volumes with the size designation
      corresponding to the largest volume. If an oversized volume is received
      for a cataloged set, retrieve earlier volumes and have them remarked to
      reflect the larger size.</P>
