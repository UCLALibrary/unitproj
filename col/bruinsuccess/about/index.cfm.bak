Designed as an introduction to academic integrity and intellectual property, Carlos and Eddie's Guide to Bruin Success with Less Stress aims to help educate UCLA students about their role in the academic community and to help them make informed choices. We hope this tutorial also engages students and demonstrates how issues related to ethical uses of information and various media formats are relevant not only to their academic careers, but also to their daily lives.
</p>
<p>
Carlos and Eddie's Guide to Bruin Success with Less Stress was created as an interactive student-centered learning experience. The tone is informal and the "quizzes" are constructed as pedagogical tools to engage users rather than scientific tools to assess users. If you choose to require your students to complete any of the five major sections, printable certificates of completion are available for each section except "Citing and Documenting Sources," which instead enables students to email their quiz results to whomever they wish.
</p>
<p>
We hope that you and your students find this tutorial interesting and informative and that it serves as a catalyst for meaningful class discussions.
