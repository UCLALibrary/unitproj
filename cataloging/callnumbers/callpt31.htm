    <H4>INTRODUCTION </H4>
    
    <P>The purpose of this document is to give some general guidelines on
      constructing call numbers using the Cataloging Department's local
      classification and/or cuttering practices. Use these local practices
      instead of LC's only for the following exceptional categories of
      materials:</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>Belles lettres in the P-PZ classification for authors who have a
        single classification or cutter number (for others, follow the LC tables
        and use Cutter-Sanborn tables). </LI>
      <LI>California cities classed in F 869. </LI>
      <LI>Music scores classed in M. </LI>
      <LI>Literary bibliographies, which are classed with the author's belles
        lettres number in P. </LI>
      <LI>Individual artists and/or their works of art classed in N. </LI>
      <LI>LC classification numbers reserved or modified for local use. </LI>
      <LI>Serials that are continuations of others. </LI>
      <LI>Series, which are classed together or separately as a local decision.
      </LI>
      <LI>Standing requests from non-cataloging units. </LI>
      <LI>Specific requests from non-cataloging units. </LI>
    </OL>
    
    <P>For a complete description of these categories, see
      <A HREF="callno1.htm"><CITE>General Call Number Policy</CITE></A>.</P>

    <H4>LOCAL CUTTER NUMBERS </H4>
    
    <P>The cutter number consists of an initial letter followed by 2, 3, or
      more Arabic numerals and, usually, a work mark (one or more lower case
      letters). These cutter numbers subarrange works alphabetically by main
      entry. If the main entry is an author, titles are distinguished by the
      work mark and often by the date of publication. The main entries
      represented by the cutter number may be persons, corporate bodies, titles,
      etc. </P>
    <OL>
      <LI> For main entries beginning with a vowel or S, use the Cutter-Sanborn
        Three-Figure Author Table. </LI>
      <LI> For main entries beginning with all other letters, use Cutter's
        Three-Figure Author Table. </LI>
    </OL>
    
    <P>If the first letters of the main entry fall between two numbers in the
      Cutter table, use or build on the first number. Do not end a cutter in &quot;0.&quot;
      Unless absolutely necessary, do not end a cutter in &quot;1&quot; because
      it impedes future insertions. For example, if you must add between D63 and
      D631, you are forced to add a zero plus a digit to expand to 4 or 5
      numbers. If the number suggested in the Cutter table has been used for
      another main entry, adjust the number for your work either up or down in
      order to maintain alphabetical order in the shelflist.</P>
    
    <P>In general, use three Arabic numerals following the initial letter.
      Fewer numerals may be used if needed to agree with already assigned
      numbers; more than three numerals may be used in order to fit an entry
      into its correct place in the shelflist.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="localwork"></A></P>
    
    <H4>WORK MARKS</H4>
    
    <P>Work marks are used with single cutter numbers (although in certain
      cases they can also be used with double cutters) and are usually taken
      from the title of the item. They are a way to distinguish between titles
      and also to keep titles with the same main entry and class number in
      alphabetical order. Work marks consist of lower case letters which are
      added to the end of the cutter number. If a cutter number with a work mark
      has already been established for the main entry in a given classification,
      expand an existing work mark to distinguish the work in hand.</P>
    
    <P>Occasionally there may need to be more than a single letter, or the work
      mark may have to be arbitrarily selected with the result that titles under
      the same main entry may not be in alphabetical order:</P>

                  F                 Caen, Herbert
                  869                 The San Francisco Book
                  S3C115

                  F                 Caen, Herbert
                  869                 Baghdad-by-the-Bay
                  S3C115b</PRE>
    
    <P>When it is necessary to use the lower-case &quot;l&quot; in a work mark,
      use a script <EM>l</EM> in the book and on the workform. This character
      will be input as the typed letter &quot;l&quot;. When it is necessary to
      use a capital letter &quot;O&quot;, add a hook at the top to distinguish
      it from the number zero. The computer keyboard distinguishes between these
      two characters so it will be entered correctly as the letter &quot;O&quot;.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="localdate"></A></P>
    
    <H4>DATE IN CALL NUMBER </H4>
    
    <P>Use the date of publication as the last element of the call number to
      distinguish between editions of the same work. For conference publications
      use the date of the conference instead of the date of publication.</P>

    <H4>DOUBLE CUTTERS</H4>
    
    <P>Locally established biographical, geographical and topical cutters will
      be continued only for the <A HREF="#lcintro">exceptions listed above.</A></P>
    
    <P>Reproduced below is the local biography cutter table we have used in the
      past; follow it now only for the exceptional categories for local call
      number practice. In all other cases, use the <CITE><A HREF="callpt22.htm#biogcut">LC
        biography table</A></CITE> and <CITE><A HREF="callapxa.htm#litbibl">Appendix
        A: Bibliography Numbers for Literary Authors (Individual Authors and
        Works</A></CITE>. </P>
    
    <P><A NAME="localbiog"></A></P>
    
    <H4>INDIVIDUAL BIOGRAPHY CUTTER TABLE </H4>

<PRE>
          x     Cutter number for the individual 
          xA2   Autobiography 
          xA3   Letters 
          xA32  Letters to one person (represented by work mark
                from the last name of that person) 
          xA4   Journals </PRE>
    
    <P><A NAME="locallit"></A></P>
    
    <H4>LITERARY DOUBLE CUTTER NUMBERS</H4>
    
    <P>Sometimes the first cutter number used is for specific literary authors.
      When classed in a national literature (P-PZ), the first cutter is an
      author notation and the second cutter follows special rules described
      under the individual literary numbers given on the following pages. </P>
    
    <P><A NAME="localtrans"></A></P>
    
    <H4>TRANSLATION WORK MARKS</H4>
    
    <P>When dealing with translations under UCLA's cuttering system, place a
      capital letter which represents the language of the translation (E =
      English, F = French, etc.) after the work mark standing for the title. Use
      a second letter in lower case when necessary (F = French, Fi = Finnish).
      If the cataloger cannot determine the original title, assign a work mark
      from the title in hand and omit the capital letter which represents the
      language of the translation.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="localabrid"></A></P>
    
    <H4>ABRIDGMENTS AND SELECTIONS</H4>
    
    <P>If the call number of the original work ends in a letter according to
      UCLA's local cuttering practice, use the digit &quot;1&quot; after the
      work mark for an abridgement or selections. Use the letter &quot;a&quot;
      if the original work's call number ends in a digit.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="localgov"></A></P>
    
    <H4>GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS</H4>
    
    <P>Do not continue to routinely use &quot;A&quot; cuttering for government
      documents except when using the call number of an earlier edition as the
      basis for assigning a new call number or when accepting the LC call number
      on cataloging for older material. (See <A HREF="callpt22.htm#documents"><CITE>Documents</CITE></A>.)</P>
