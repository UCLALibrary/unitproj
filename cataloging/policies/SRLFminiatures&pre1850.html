              <p>This memo restates one first issued by Brian Schottlaender on 
                August 18, 1988. It is still in effect.</p>
              <p>Please be aware of, and observe, the following processing guidelines 
                agreed to for SRLF materials:</p>
              <ol>
                <li> ALL miniature volumes for YRL (14 cm. or less) are to be 
                  processed for the SRLF unless otherwise indicated by a Bibliographer;</li>
                <li>ALL pre-1850 volumes for YRL are to be processed for the SRLF 
                  unless otherwise indicated by a Bibliographer;</li>
                <li>Neither miniature nor oversize volumes destined for the SRLF 
                  from any campus location should have [Min.], [*], [**], or [***] 
                  preceding the call number.</li>
