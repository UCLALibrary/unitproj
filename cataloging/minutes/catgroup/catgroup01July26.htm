<P>I. "ACC Guidelines for Cataloging Materials with Chinese Text or Access Points" </P>

<P>Sarah Elman distributed a copy of the new "ACC Guidelines for Cataloging Materials with Chinese Text or Access Points", dated July 26, 2001. She reviewed the outline and examples with the Cataloger's Group. This latest update is at the end of these minutes.</P>

<P>II. July 25 AdCon presentation on Electronic Resources Database </P>

<P>John Riemer distributed copies of the Adcon UCLA Library Web Site Redesign Report, the Digital Acquisitions Database (DAD) Policy Issues Discussion Document, and a 2-page document listing the types of electronic resources to be included in a UCLA Electronic Resource Database (ERD) and showing the overlap between ERD &amp; DAD.</P>

<P>The AULs have authorized building a separate, publicly available database of online resources. This database would include electronic serials; electronic databases; links to web home pages, search engines, subject guides, instructional materials, reference tools; and CDL selected digital resources.</P>

<P>The group discussed the usefulness of having a separate database when the Orion2 online catalog already contains bibliographic records for electronic resources. The group also discussed different ways, such as exporting CORC records to the OPAC, which in turn can be used to feed or populate the separate database.</P>

<P>John reported that he would like to hyperlink captions from a web page containing the LC classification outline, as a means of providing subject access to these electronic </P>
<P>resources.  Clicking on the captions would take users to the e-resources classified in those areas.  The indentations among the captions on such a web page would guide patrons browsing up and down hierarchies.  He experimented and found that we could use a 699 field for multi-topic resources, e.g. one on art and psychotherapy.  In lieu of using terminology in LCC, the AULs have charged ACC to create a controlled vocabulary of approximately fifty terms.</P>

<P>Jeff Morehead suggested adding to the Orion2 OPAC a search option for limiting to electronic resources. Valerie Bross and Luiz Mendes had already made this recommendation in the past. </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">(August 1, 2001-completion of pinyin conversion project)  </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Revised July 26, 2001</P>

<B><P>Background</P>
</B>
<P>Due to the change in the Chinese romanization system from Wade-Giles to pinyin, a set of interim cataloging guidelines for UCLA was issued in October 2000 for UCLA catalogers dealing with Chinese language materials or materials on China. As of early July 2001, OCLC has completed the conversion of all Chinese records in its WorldCat database. OCLC is refining the conversion program so it can be used to convert non-Chinese records containing Chinese text strings and access points.</P>

<P>For the conversion of records already in UCLA’s ORION2 database, a decision has been made to extract selected records (all records containing the language code &quot;chi&quot; in the 008/35-37 field and non-Chinese records containing &quot;chi&quot; code in the 041 field) from TAOS and send them to OCLC for conversion. The date for extraction has been set for August 1, 2001. However, the date for the actual conversion is contingent upon OCLC’s schedule. We anticipate that the project will be completed by the end of this year.</P>

<P>In order not to bring in records containing Wade-Giles text or access points after August 1, the guidelines below should be followed by the entire UCLA cataloging community starting July 30. This set of guidelines applies to <B>ANY</B> bibliographic records that include <B>romanized Chinese</B> characters (in either description or access points), regardless of the primary language of the materials. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>I.  Bib Search</B> </P>
<DIR>

<P>When searching for Chinese titles on OCLC, search the pinyin form. However, when searching on ORION2, use both Wade-Giles and pinyin forms until the local database has been converted. Utilize Boolean operator OR for an efficient search. </P>

<P>Do <B>not</B> edit TAOS records that meet <I>both</I> of the following criteria:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<OL TYPE="a">

<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>The language code &quot;<B>chi</B>&quot; exists in either <B>008/35-37</B> or <B>041</B>; and</LI>
<LI>The record was loaded into TAOS before July 31, 2001. </LI></OL>
</OL>

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>These records will be overlaid after the conversion of local file is done by OCLC  </P>

<P>However, if you find any record loaded into TAOS after July 31, 2001, that contains Wade-Giles text in the descriptive fields, be sure to manually convert it to pinyin and add the 987 field to the TAOS record. </P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<B><U><P>Note</P>
</B></U>
<P>*  The converted non-unique name authority records (i.e., records covering more than one person, coded <B>b</B> in 008/32 (Name)) are being reviewed and edited manually by LC and some Chinese NACO contributors. Many of these records can be split into unique name records. If you encounter non-unique name records that need modification, refer them to Sarah S. Elman at <A HREF="mailto:selman@library.ucla.edu">selman@library.ucla.edu</A> or x69606. </P>
