    <H3>INTRODUCTION </H3>
    
    <P>The purpose of this document is to give some general guidelines on
      constructing call numbers according to the Library of Congress practice
      and to document Cataloging Department policy on how this practice is to be
      applied. </P>
    
    <P>For a more detailed presentation of how LC applies its own
      classification and cuttering, see the <CITE>Subject Cataloging Manual,
      Shelflisting</CITE>, which is available in the Cataloging Department
      Shelflist area. </P>
    
    <P>A Library of Congress call number for a monograph usually consists of
      three elements: (1) the classification number; (2) the cutter number; and
      (3) the date. (A call number for a serial contains only the first two
      elements in the bibliographic record.) </P>
    
    <P>When using Library of Congress cataloging copy, it is the Cataloging
      Department's general policy to accept the call number as it appears in the
      record. Exceptions to this policy are set forth in <CITE><A HREF="callno1.htm">
        <B>General Call Number Policy</B></A>.</CITE> Accept 050 LC call
      numbers as they appear in cataloging records even if the numbers are
      constructed according to a superseded practice, e.g., do not add a date to
      the call number of a monograph if it is missing. When using contributed
      copy (NUC), accept LC-type call numbers in the 090 field; however, check
      that the cutter number in the subfield $b is formulated according to the
      latest revised version of the LC cutter table, and adjust it if it is not.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="lcclass"></A></P>
    
    <H3>CLASSIFICATION NUMBER</H3>
    
    <P>The classification number consists of one, two or three capital letters
      representing the major subject field of the piece and one or more Arabic
      numerals representing the more specific subject. The published Library of
      Congress classification schedules are used to determine these. A master
      set of LC schedules, including cumulative updates, is kept in the
      shelflist area. Note that the classification may include a subarrangement,
      i.e., a topical, geographic or biographical cutter. </P>
    
    <P>In the schedules it is necessary to be cautious in the use of &quot;divide
      like&quot; notes referring from one number to another number for a pattern
      subarrangement. Detailed subdivisions of subjects are often treated by the
      use of auxiliary tables, e.g., (1) general or literary forms, (2)
      geographic, (3) chronological, (4) subject subdivisions consisting of
      alphabetical lists of special topics, and (5) a combination of the various
      tables. Follow directions in using such tables carefully. </P>
    
    <P><A NAME="lccut"></A></P>
    
    <H3>CUTTER NUMBER </H3>
    
    <P>The cutter number (or book number) distinguishes a particular work from
      others in the same class. Use the latest revised version of the Library of
      Congress cutter number table as given in the <CITE>Subject Cataloging
      Manual, Shelflisting</CITE>, G 060, p. 26, and as posted in the shelflist
      area. Library of Congress cutter numbers are usually composed of the
      initial letter of the main entry heading, generally followed by two Arabic
      numerals representing the succeeding letters of the heading. </P>
    
    <P>When cuttering for main entries beginning with numerals, use the cutters
      <STRONG>A12-A19</STRONG>, so that these will precede any alphabetic
      titles cuttered to &quot;A&quot; in the classification number. </P>
    
    <P>Cutter numbers are decimal, thus allowing for infinite interpolation of
      the decimal principle. Unless absolutely necessary, do not use &quot;1&quot;
      as a cutter, since using this digit can block normal arrangement of the
      alphabetic file. Since the tables provide only a general framework for the
      assignment of classification numbers, the cutter number(s) for a
      particular name or work is constant only within a single class. </P>
    
    <P><B>REMINDER:</B> LC now arranges surnames beginning with M', Mc and Mac
      as they are spelled; this treatment will therefore affect the cuttering
      for such names when they form part of a call number. See the <CITE>Subject
      Cataloging Manual, Shelflisting</CITE>, Section G 100 for details. </P>
    
    <P>Although the Cataloging Department's original aim was to preserve
      alphabetical order in the shelflist, superimposition of the LC cuttering
      system over UCLA's local cuttering system does not allow the cataloger to
      do this in many classification areas. If the item does not fall into one
      of the <A HREF="callno1.htm#exc"><CITE>Exceptions to LC Practice</CITE></A>
      and there is no special cuttering request from a non-cataloging unit or
      bibliographer, the cataloger should not strive for alphabetical order in
      the shelflist but should follow LC's own cuttering practice as set forth
      in the <CITE>Subject Cataloging Manual, Shelflisting</CITE>. <B>This
      also applies to all editions and translations, regardless of any
      previously established call number in the shelflist.</B> Make no special
      attempt to keep all manifestations of a work together unless specifically
      requested. <B>ACCEPT THE LC CALL NUMBER UNLESS THERE IS A CONFLICT</B>.
    </P>

    <H3>DATE IN CALL NUMBER </H3>
    
    <P>UCLA's current policy, effective May 16, 1983, is to add the date of
      publication to the call number for all monographs. This is in keeping with
      LC's implementation of the same policy, as announced in <CITE>Cataloging
      Service Bulletin</CITE> 19 (Winter 1982) and as modified in <CITE>Cataloging
      Service Bulletin</CITE> 41 (Summer 1988). </P>

    <P>Below is listed the shelflist order to be constructed according to the
      guidelines in the <CITE>Subject Cataloging Manual, Shelflisting</CITE>.
      Be cautious when checking newly created entries against those already
      existing in our shelflist. Because of former policies, as well as current
      local practices for certain specified areas, you may not discern this same
      &quot;correct&quot; order when going through our shelflist. Unless
      otherwise called for, apply the guidelines of the<CITE>Subject Cataloging
      Manual, Shelflisting</CITE> regardless of how the new entries may
      interfile with those already existing. </P>
