            <h1>LC <i>vs.</i> Local Cutters Policy</h1>
            <p>Memo from Carol Hixson<br />
              Dec. 15, 1998</p>
            <p>You'll recall that starting with Fall quarter, we decided to follow 
              LC classification and cuttering practices for all but some explicitly-exempted 
              materials classified in the M's, some Special Collections materials, 
              and UCLA theses and dissertations.</p>
            <p>Several people have since approached me wondering what to do in 
              specific circumstances. What do we do when the LC cutter for a belles 
              lettres author, or an artist, or a person who is the subject of 
              a biographical work has already been used locally for another author 
              or artist? Do we use what we know to be the LC cutter for the person 
              and ignore the conflicts? Do we modify the cutter on the book we're 
              cataloging so that it follows the LC style but avoids a local conflict? 
              Do we reclassify the titles already in the local database?</p>
            <p>Using Claire Bellanti's motto of &quot;the future is longer than 
              the past&quot;, our policy will be to use the LC cutter whenever 
              we know what it is for anything that we're cataloging new (with 
              the exceptions listed above). We will not attempt to reconcile conflicts, 
              nor will we go back and attempt to reclassify previously-cataloged 
              titles. If we are already recataloging a title *for another reason*, 
              we may reclassify it to use the LC cutter at that time.</p>
            <p>Currently, about 49% of what we catalog new has DLC copy. Those 
              titles are going into the local catalog without the call number 
              being reviewed. Also, a growing percentage of our original and member 
              copy cataloging is being done at the PCC level and we are using 
              LC cutters for those materials. The future will soon outstrip the 
              past.</p>
            <p>Anyone who has used the online or paper shelf list locally knows 
              that there are already many conflicts where the same cutter has 
              been used for more than one person. This happened at a time when 
              we were supposedly checking all local cutters. If we could live 
              with it before, we can live with it now. There will be times when 
              the same cutter may have been used to represent three of four people 
              in our local catalog. C'est la vie. We don't have time to go back 
              and fix all the mistakes of the past nor to reconcile all the changes 
              in policy over the years.</p>
            <p>How far do we have to look to find the LC cutter when doing non-DLC 
              copy or original cataloging? Look at 050's on bib records in our 
              database. Look at 050's on bib records in OCLC. Look at 053 fields 
              on authority records for belles lettres authors. If you have made 
              a reasonable search of the person in the local and the national 
              database and can find no evidence of an LC cutter, use one that 
              will not conflict with anything that we have locally.</p>
            <p>If there are other specific questions about this policy, please 
              ask me and we'll refine it as needed.</p>
