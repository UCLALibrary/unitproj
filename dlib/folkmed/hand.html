                                                    Wayland Hand was born
                                                    in 1907 and died in
                                                    route to the American
                                                    Folklore Society in
                                                    1986. He was born in
                                                    New Zealand and was a
                                                    scholar of German by
                                                    training.

                                                    After teaching briefly
                                                    at the University of
                                                    Minnesota, Hand joined
                                                    the faculty at UCLA.
                                                    True to its
                                                    disciplinary origins
                                                    the Folklore and
                                                    Mythology Program and
                                                    Archive at UCLA came
                                                    out of the study of
                                                    Germanic languages and
                                                    literatures.

 In 1939, Wayland Hand taught the first
introductory class ever offered in folklore at UCLA. 

He was instrumental, along with folk song scholar
D. K. Wilgus, in founding the Folklore and Mythology Program at UCLA.


 Hand was respected as both a scholar and a
teacher.  He achieved much in his life, serving as founder and editor of the
journal Western Folklore, presiding over the American Folklore Society,
winning the Pitré Prize for a published work
on folklore of international significance, and being elected a Fellow of the
American Folklore Society as well as knighted in Finland.
<p>
In perhaps no other endeavor was Hand as tireless
and unceasing as he was in developing the Folk Medicine Archive.  After
helping establish folklore studies at UCLA, he devoted the rest of his life
to collecting, archiving, and writing about folk beliefs and medical practices.
