<p>
<span class="quiz_number">Question 1 of 8:</span>
Eddie copies and pastes a few sentences from a web site into his paper. The web site doesn't list an author, sponsor or a date. Eddie should...
<form name="q1form">
<input type="radio" name="q1answer" value="a" onClick="checkAnswer(1)" class="form"> <strong>a. Not quote or cite it. There's not enough information to write a citation and if it's on the web, it's public information and is considered common knowledge.</strong><br><br>
<input type="radio" name="q1answer" value="b" onClick="checkAnswer(1)" class="form"> <strong>b. Quote and cite it.</strong><br>
</form>
</p>
</div>


<div class="quiz_a">
<div id="q1a">
<p>
Nope. Eddie needs to quote it and cite it using the available information. And not everything on the web is common knowledge. PLUS, Eddie really needs to think twice about using this site as part of his research-he doesn't even know who wrote it or when it was written! (For more, <a href="03.cfm" target="_blank">see "What to Cite,"</a> and <a href="06.cfm" target="_blank">"Cite at the End."</a>)

<!-- question 2 -->

<div id="q2">
<p>
<span class="quiz_number">Question 2 of 8:</span>
While writing his paper, Eddie looks through his class notes and finds something his professor said that would totally support his argument. Eddie includes it in his paper. Eddie should...
<form name="q2form">
<input type="radio" name="q2answer" value="a" class="form" onClick="checkAnswer(2)">  <strong>a. Quote and cite it.</strong><br><br>

</form>
</p>
</div>

<div class="quiz_a">
<div id="q2a">
<p>
Yes. Eddie should definitely quote and cite it. He's using someone else's ideas and words&mdash;even if they were spoken. (For more, <a href="03.cfm" target="_blank">see "What to Cite."</a>)

<!-- question 3 -->

<div id="q3">
<p>
<span class="quiz_number">Question 3 of 8:</span>
Eddie starts documenting his sources using MLA style. Halfway through his paper, he decides that he likes APA style better so he switches. Does he have to go back and change his MLA citations to APA, or does it not matter?
<form name="q3form">
<input type="radio" name="q3answer" value="a" class="form" onClick="checkAnswer(3)"> <strong>a. Go back and change them.</strong><br><br>
<input type="radio" name="q3nswer" value="b" class="form" onClick="checkAnswer(3)"> <strong>b. It doesn't matter.</strong><br>
</form>
</p>
</div>

<div class="quiz_a">
<div id="q3a">
<p>
Yes. It is good that Eddie documented his sources&mdash;that is the most important thing. But it is better if he sticks with one citation style throughout his paper. Many instructors would lower Eddie's mark if he inaccurately or inconsistently followed a citation style. (For more, <a href="04.cfm" target="_blank">see "How to Cite: Do It with Style."</a>)

<!-- question 4 -->

<div id="q4">
<p>
<span class="quiz_number">Question 4 of 8:</span>
If Eddie provides in-text citations, should he also write a list of complete citations at the end of his paper?
<form name="q4form">
<input type="radio" name="q4answer" value="a" class="form" onClick="checkAnswer(4)"> <strong>a. As long as he cites his source, he's OK. He can just use in-text citations.</strong><br><br>
<input type="radio" name="q4nswer" value="b" class="form" onClick="checkAnswer(4)"> <strong>b. Eddie should also provide a list of citations at the end of his paper if he provides in-text citations.</strong><br>
</form>
</p>
</div>

<div class="quiz_a">
<div id="q4a">
<p>
Nope. In-text citations point the reader to the appropriate complete citation for the source at the end of a paper. They are used together so Eddie should use both. Always check the citation manual for the style you're using for details. (For more, <a href="05.cfm" target="_blank">see "How to Cite: During and After."</a>)

<!-- question 6 -->

<div id="q6">
<p>
<span class="quiz_number">Question 6 of 8:</span>
Eddie summarizes a really long article. Eddie is skeptical of the statements made in the article and includes those feelings within the summary. Is that OK?
<form name="q6form">
<input type="radio" name="q6answer" value="a" class="form" onClick="checkAnswer(6)"> <strong>a. Sure. It's important for Eddie to express his criticisms.</strong><br><br>
<input type="radio" name="q6nswer" value="b" class="form" onClick="checkAnswer(6)"> <strong>b. No. The summary should just stay true to the source.</strong><br>
</form>
</p>
</div>


<div class="quiz_a">
<div id="q6a">
<p>
Nope. The summary should stay true to the source and Eddie must make a clear distinction between his thoughts and words and someone else's. (For more, <a href="10.cfm" target="_blank">see "Tips on Summarizing."</a>)

Eddie includes citations in his paper because:

<input type="radio" name="q7answer" value="b" class="form" onClick="checkAnswer(7)"> <strong>b. Citations take up space in his paper.</strong><br><br>
<input type="radio" name="q7answer" value="c" class="form" onClick="checkAnswer(7)"> <strong>c. Documenting sources is what scholars do when they are engaging in written academic conversations.</strong><br><br>
<input type="radio" name="q7answer" value="d" class="form" onClick="checkAnswer(7)"> <strong>d. a and b</strong><br><br>

</p>

<div class="quiz_a">
<div id="q7a">
<p>
Yes, but there's more. There are many reasons why Eddie should cite and document his sources. Adding credibility to his work and following the conventions used by scholars when engaging in written academic conversations are just two. Taking up space in his paper is just an added bonus but not a reason for including citations in his paper. (For more, <a href="02.cfm" target="_blank">see "Why Cite."</a>)
