Sloppy note-taking can really get you in trouble, so invest some time in taking careful notes.
</p>

<p>
Here's an old school note-taking method that people have been using for eons. Use this, adapt it, or develop your own system. 
</p>

<div class="inset">

<h2>Real Student Comment</h2>

<p>
If you use this method and do it correctly, you can't accidentally plagiarize. Like, it's impossible to mess up if you do this.
</p>

</div>

<p>
You'll need index cards, different colored pens/highlighters, and your sources. 
</p>

<p>
Your cards could look something like this: 
</p>

<div align="center">

<h2>Quote</h2>
<p>
<img src="images/03_12_quote.gif" alt="Giles' Role: Buffy 'relies on Giles not only for adult support and coaching, but also for the research necessary to do that for which the Slayer has been chosen'" width="234" height="141" border="0">
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
<img src="images/03_12_summary.gif" alt="Giles' Role: To help her fulfill her Slayer duties, Buffy can always turn to Giles" width="234" height="140" border="0">
</p>

<h2>Paraphrase</h2>
<p>
<img src="images/03_12_paraphrase.gif" alt="Giles' Role: Despite his termination by the Watcher's Council in season three, Giles persists to teach and counsel Buffy while playing a 'father figure' role." width="234" height="140" border="0">
</p>

<h2>Your Own Ideas</h2>
<p>
<img src="images/03_12_yourideas.gif" alt="Giles' Role: Giles' master research skills are as important and powerful as Buffy's strength-his books are as vital to defeating evil as Buffy's chest of weapons." width="234" height="140" border="0">
</p>

</div>


<p><strong>On the front of the card</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the upper left corner, color code the cards&mdash;use one color for quotes, another for summaries, another for paraphrases and another for your own thoughts. Or, you can write Q, S, P or Me.</li>
<li>In the upper right corner, write the topic of the quote, summary, paraphrase or your original thought.</li>
<li>In the center, write your quote (use quotation marks), summary, paraphrase or your original thought.</li>
</ol>

<h2>On the back of the card:</h2>
<p>
Write the citation, or some code for the citation info,
<img src="images/03_12_back.gif" alt="DeCandido: 'Bibliographic Good vs. Evil in Buffy...' page 44" width="234" height="140" border="0" align="right" hspace="10">
 like the author's last name and first few words of the title. Include the page number(s) too. If you use a code, be sure to have the complete citation info somewhere for later use.
</p>

<p>Using a note-taking system like this will help you:</p>

<ul>
<li>quickly distinguish quotes, summaries, paraphrases and your thoughts from one another</li>
<li>organize your information&mdash;you can shuffle and categorize your note cards based on the topics you've assigned them and write your outline faster</li>
<li>easily work in your citations as you write</li>
</ul>
