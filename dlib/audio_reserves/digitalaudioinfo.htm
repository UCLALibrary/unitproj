<p>Online listening assignments are provided as a service to 
UCLA Music faculty and students. The listening examples are drawn from 
the UCLA Music Library collections, and if necessary, from the collections
of the instructor. Listening assignments are made available only for the
duration of the class for which they are intended, and access is limited 
to the students enrolled in the class.</p>

<p>The Music Library adheres to the <a href="http://www.library.ucla.edu/copyright/" style="text-decoration: none" target="_top">UCLA Library copyright policies</a>, 
and in particular to policies regarding <a href="http://www.library.ucla.edu/copyright/ereserv.htm" style="text-decoration: none" target="_top">Electronic Reserve operations</a>.
Music Library policies and practices have also been informed by the Music Library Association <a href="http://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/Copyright/ereserves.htm" style="text-decoration: none" target="_top">guidelines on the digital transmission of electronic reserves</a>.</p>

<p>The files are streamed to the user's workstation on demand. Most of the 
files provided are in the RealMedia format (real.com), but Quicktime 
is used for some classes. In order to play the musical examples users 
must have the <a href="http://www.real.com" style="text-decoration: none" target="_top">RealPlayer</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/" style="text-decoration: none" target="_top">Quicktime</a> clients (as appropriate) on their workstation.</p>

<p>Faculty should submit requests for the creation of online listening assignments 
well in advance of each quarter. A form for making the request is available from the Reserves Assistant.
The form can also be <a href="audioreservesrequest.doc" style="text-decoration: none" target="_top">downloaded</a> (Word 97 format) or submitted <a href="" style="text-decoration: none">via the web</a>.</p>

<p>The RealMedia files are encoded for two different streaming rates: 16kbps and 82kbps. 
The lower rate allows access via a modem; the higher rate is appropriate for broadband
connections. The Real server automatically provides the appropriate stream depending
on the bandwidth available (bandwidth negotiation).</p>
