<DIR>

</B><P>On August 24, it was decided that approximately 6,500 serials would be migrated from the OPAC.  In preparation, clean up needed to done on 1,800 records with no usable call number, 100 records with subfield coding errors in 856s, and records lacking e-coverage in 856 $3 or $z.  (Biomed and SEL shared in the clean up, with Valerie editing an average of 100 titles per day.)</P>

<P>Migration of serials from the OPAC into ERDb was expected the week of September 24.  The recent virus delayed this and David Yamamoto’s creating the public interface.</P>

<P>In early September, Andy Kohler &quot;scraped&quot; 6,119 titles (websites and databases from the CIRD pages); duplicates were eliminated based on title and URL.  Music Library pages were completed this week.  Clean-up involves examination of the 7 required elements:</P></DIR>

<OL>

<OL>

<LI>Resource title (brought over from CIRD page)</LI>
<LI>Resource URL (brought over from CIRD page)</LI>
<LI>Language (defaulted to English automatically) </LI>
<LI>Access restrictions (check to see if the default was right)</LI>
<LI>Subject area (default-assigned based on the page resource was taken from)</LI>
<LI>Material type</LI>
<LI>Web display (verify that it is enabled)</LI></OL>
</OL>

<DIR>

<P>Initial plans were for the first pass of monographic e-resource clean up to be done by the Cataloging Department (Chamya Kincy in Records Management, trained in ERDb by Angela Riggio).  The advantage of our participation would have been adding Orion2 DBCNs to ERDb records to pave the way for overlay of better data in later phases.  Instead, Angela Riggio became part of a team involved in ERDb training all campus libraries: SEL staff was trained on September 14; YRL Bibliographers September 17 and 18; Biomed September 20; and Arts and Music during the last week of September.</P>

<P>Upon reflection, the Bibs thought it would be better for YRL Cataloging not to be involved at this point, and they decided they would to do the first round of clean up themselves.  This is beneficial for a number of reasons.  </P>

<P>They are better situated for deciding on the need for keywords and narrative descriptions.  They could judge whether all the resources on a given CIRD page warranted inclusion in ERDb.  Up to now no one outside Cataloging has tested inputting Subject and Material Type descriptors.  Bibs could be sources for suggestions for additions to the material type descriptor list.  They need to judge how far to pursue repair of broken links.  Consolidation of data on duplicate records onto a single record involves communication within that group.  Selectors would be better judges how adequately ERDb can take the place of their static pages.</P>

<P>Issues raised in the migration of websites and databases:</P></DIR>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>resolution of duplicate records and the function of keywords (augmentation of controlled vocabulary or subarrangement device under Subject descriptor);</LI></UL>
</UL>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>present organization and display of the resources in ERDb (as compared to the original web pages developed by Bibs 3 years ago);</LI>
<LI>general direction to proceed with the Subject descriptor list: keep list short for feasibility of the pull-down list used by patrons OR expand it so descriptors can more closely parallel names of academic departments and average number of resources appearing each descriptor is reduced?   (After a last-second adjustment to break History into 7 subcategories, John requested that the original mapping be left as developed for now.);</LI>
<LI>difficulty in assigning a Material Type descriptor to some resources, as the Bibs have found out;</LI>
<LI>handling of vernacular titles (will transliteration from the cataloging record go into Resource Title and the selector’s loose translation go into Display Title?)  Where would the contents of an 880 field go?</LI>
<LI>variant titles do not currently have a place in ERDb.</LI></UL>
</UL>

<DIR>

<P>Timetable for ERDb has shifted back a week, and there will be one week for information/input from staff to be gathered.  A Catalogers Group meeting to collect staff input might be held in October.</P>
</DIR>

<P>John solicited questions and comments from Catalogers Group members:</P>
<OL>

<LI>questioned the need for a separate database for e-resources; </LI>
<LI>are concerned about short timeline for implementation of database and release to public;</LI>
<LI>anticipated possible negative impact on user and public service staff; </LI>
<LI>questioned narrow scope of ERDb in excluding e-monographs and confusion it may cause to users who will be required to search two separate systems for materials;</LI>
<LI>found link to OPAC on newly-redesigned UCLA Library home page not prominent enough;</LI>
<LI>asked whether ERDb would be publicized to staff and students before release.</LI></OL>

<DIR>

<P>From the cataloging perspective, John saw benefit in minimizing our direct involvement in ERDB cleanup, in favor of cataloging more e-resources in CORC.</P>
</DIR>

<OL>

<B><LI>Request for 655 field for DVD-ROMs</LI></OL>

</B><DIR>

<P>Sara Layne proposed to ACC the use of the genre heading (1) for all DVDs (computer files), based on the existing genre headings for computer files (CD-ROMs (2) and e-resources (3)):</P></DIR>

<P> </P>
<OL>

<LI>655 _7 DVD-ROMs. $2 lcsh</LI>
<LI>655 _7 CD-ROMs. $2 lcsh</LI>
<LI>655 _7 Online resources. $2 local</LI></OL>


<P>Group members did not object to proposal.</P>

<OL>

<B><LI>OCLC Pacific Update Meeting</LI></OL>

</B><P>Held in San Bernardino on September 19, 2001.  Issues that impact cataloging:</P>
<DIR>

<P>1. OCLC Bibliographic Record Notification service presently includes changes to 505 and to 856 ($u and $z) fields.  [From research he and Jean did after the meeting, records furnished can either overlay/ replace of MARC record or serve as a notification for copy-and-paste work.]</P>
<P>(As pointed out by Valerie Bross, it would be nice if notification also included serial title changes.  The scope is limited to notification about 856 fields: additions, changes, and deletions of URLs, as in CORC).</P>
</DIR>

<P>2. Late in 2001 OCLC will begin migration to Oracle with support for UNICODE.</P>

<P>3. OCLC Metadata Desktop will replace PASSPORT in July 2003.</P>

<P>Next meetings: October 11 and 25</P>

<P>Topic: Dublin Core Data Elements </P>
<P>to include:</P>
<OL>

<LI>Why is it not a threat to cataloging?</LI>
<LI>Dublin Core 15 data elements and their corresponding MARC values.</LI>
<LI>Experiences in Georgia using Dublin Core.</LI>
<LI>Issues raised by use of DC: Loading records in the OPAC, etc.</LI></OL>
