            <h3>April 11, 2003</h3>
            <h3>Subject bibliographies falling into Z5000+</h3>
            <p>For all locations including branches, classify subject-related 
              bibliographies with other materials on the same subject. This will 
              make for a more usable, browsable collection in the long term. Apply 
              this only to newly-cataloged materials.</p>
            <p>Exception: Serial title changes, involving continuity of a single 
              numbering system across multiple records, should have the same call 
              number on the complete run of volumes.</p>
            <h3>Bibliographies of literary authors falling into Z8000+</h3>
            <p>Classify bibliographies of literary authors with the authors' works, 
              i.e. using the P schedules and their instructions for assigning 
              cutters. Bibliography is considered Biography and criticism.</p>
            <p>Bibliographies of literary authors that were previously classified 
              in Z will be reclassified at the request of bibliographers and reference 
              librarians. New and reclassified bibliographies will receive LC-style 
              cutters for authors, including those that have established local 
              cutters. We will not reclassify the works of a literary author for 
              the purpose of changing the local UCLA cutter to the LC cutter.</p>
