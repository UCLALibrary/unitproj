In a nutshell, five forms of academic dishonesty are:

<br clear="all">

<ol>
<li>
<strong><a href="JavaScript:Gloss('34');">cheating</a></strong><br>
Some examples of cheating would be: obtaining an unauthorized copy of a test, quiz, assignment, etc.; having someone else do the work for you; using notes, calculators, etc. without authorization while taking a test/quiz or while completing an assignment; changing answers on a graded assignment/quiz/test/etc. and then asking the instructor to re-grade it.
</li>

<li>
<strong><a href="JavaScript:Gloss('35');">fabrication</a></strong> <br>
Some examples of fabrication would be: making up data; changing data to support your hypothesis; claiming to have consulted sources that you really didn't use.
</li>

<li>
<strong><a href="JavaScript:Gloss('28');">plagiarism</a></strong> <br>
This includes presenting someone's words, ideas, or any other work that can be considered intellectual property as if they were your own. Even if you accidentally plagiarize because you forgot to document your sources or inaccurately documented your sources, you could still end up accused of academic dishonesty.
</li>

<li>
<strong><a href="JavaScript:Gloss('37');">multiple submissions</a></strong> <br>
This means, you can't turn in an assignment from a previous quarter for a class you're taking now without permission from your current instructor. If you're taking two classes with a similar assignment and you want to turn in one paper (or project) for both classes, you would have to get permission from both instructors.
</li>

<li>
<strong><a href="JavaScript:Gloss('38');">facilitating academic dishonesty</a></strong><br>
Some examples of facilitating academic dishonesty would include helping someone else cheat, fabricate, plagiarize or anything else that would compromise his or her academic integrity.

<h2>Not Just About School</h2>
<p>
Have you heard about the journalism scandal at the New York Times? A reporter recently resigned after it was discovered that he had fabricated and plagiarized a number of stories including a few about missing soldiers in Iraq, an interview with Pfc. Jessica Lynch's father, and even stories about the Washington sniper case in 2002. For students, fabrication and plagiarism will get you kicked out of school. For professionals, fabrication and plagiarism will cost you your job and your reputation.
