<LI>Update from John on ACC</LI></OL>


<P>ACC discussed keyword indexing for all info in the 856 and the 910 fields.  John asked about indexing of 6XXs, i.e. genre vs. topic, but differentiating between the two was seen as a display versus indexing issue.  They were interested in the ability to search, not just limit, by date, but indexing of 008 is problematic.  Indexing of 260 $c and 033 (broadcast date) might have to substitute for the 008. </P>

<P>Taos-SIRS voting results</P>

<P>Note: Every ACC member got 10 votes to spend on up to 5 choices.  Prior to the ACC discussion, John redistributed YRL’s votes as follows:</P>

<P>56  --  Delete holdings and item at one time                                                   2</P>
<P>59  --  Search without ID type                                                                       3</P>
<P>62  --  Cut/Copy/Paste multi-fields                                                                 2</P>
<P>70  --  Stop Search button                                                                            3 </P>
<P>66  --  Suppress record</P>

<P>ACC passed up #59, because TPAC’s voting had already assured that proposal would go forward.  John was told #70 is already possible to accomplish.  So, John moved his 3 votes each from #59 and #70 to</P>
<P>95 – Global search and replace of specified fields and subfields.</P>
<P>105 – Global heading change in bib records by changing 1XX of authority record</P>

<P>2. Update on Fast-moving ERDb developments</P>

<P>Last week the thinking was that ERDb would be built from 3 different sources in Phase 1:</P>
<P>-- CDL directory</P>
<P>-- Biomed database of licensed resources </P>
<P>-- ‘cird’ pages (of databases and websites Bibs had put up)</P>

<P>Catalog records would not be used for anything prior to Phase 2.  ACC was going to be charged with creating 3 more mappings to get from the subject descriptors in those 3 different source files to the list of about 80 subjects ACC compiled earlier.</P>

<P>John didn’t see how the Phase 1 approach would be any faster &amp; easier than the Phase 2 approach of migrating from the OPAC as a single source.  </P>

<UL>
<LI>Time to create 3 more mappings.</LI>
<LI>Deduping the results (CDL directory has one record for each URL a given title is available from &amp; there is title overlap among the 3 sources)</LI>
<LI>URL maintenance efficiency: UCLA pays UCSD to maintain PIDs &amp; those are in OPAC.  If you migrate from CDL you get URLs that we’d have to maintain ourselves.  (John thanked Valerie for this providing him this information.)</LI></UL>


<P>After expressing his concerns to Terry, he got an appointment to talk about things.</P>
<P>By the time of the Aug. 19 meeting, there were only two sources for building ERDb in Phase 1.  In place of the CDL Directory was David Yamamoto’s database of e-journals.  The ‘cird’ pages would still be the source for databases and websites.  E-books like NetLibrary and GPO monographs were definitely not wanted in ERDb.  </P>

<P>How soon MARC records could become the source of ERDb data depended on when the needed data would be available.  Phase 1 is only going to last until Sept 30.  One crucial thing David’s database of 4,000 titles lacks is subject access.  With ACC’s mapping, human intervention to assign descriptors could be avoided.  If you picked out any BLvl-s record with an 856 field, you could get almost 2,000 more serials into ERDb and get most subject descriptors automatically assigned.</P>

<P>For databases and websites, the situation is murkier.  Do we have &quot;all&quot; the needed records ERDb would want in Orion2?  (To select from O2, we would want records with 856 present, BLvl m, and ending date 9999, to exclude e-books.)  The most our department could have hoped for was the ability to claim we had CORC records in O2 for everything on the Bibs’ pages.  However, there were questions about what data from the Bibs’ pages was carried into the OPAC.  Examples included the summary and what category and subcategory on the Bibs’ page the resource got listed under, e.g. Music--Opera.  Another question was whether all the SEL &amp; Biomed databases accounted for in O2?</P>

<P>John showed her the Powerpoint he did for CMC on August 1 and Catalogers Group on August 9.  She generally liked it.  We’ve seen the more detailed workflow plan proposed for building ERDb from MARC records.  She gave praise for going beyond the mere statement, &quot;all the data you need for ERDb can be found in the MARC record.&quot;  Her two concerns were (1) the moving of data back and forth (John pointed out that the mapping from call#s would happen for most titles only one time, not over and over again) and (2) the ability to get needed titles into the OPAC quickly (John told her about BibCORC and gave her a quick demo on her PC).</P>

<P>It was helpful that CORC offers a Dublin Core view that would be more comfortable for Reference librarians.  John had to be willing to give OCLC signons to all staff who needed them.</P>

<P>Andy Kohler would be asked about overall feasibility August 20.  His review was favorable.  Terry soon called to say there were too many questions about the databases, preventing them from being migrated from Orion in the first phase.  She would undertake a three-day analysis to evaluate the better source of the serials [announced as Orion2 on Aug. 24].</P>

<P>Two questions were raised about whether the MARC records had data elements equivalent to what David Yamamoto had in his list:  </P>
<P>--E-vols. coverage (in 856 $3 or 362 ) and </P>
<P>--Whether the resource was restricted or not (in 856 $z)</P>

<P>On August 21, JR got detailed questions from Andy K about call# parsing.  We might get list soon of all bib records without call# fields needed to support the mapping 090/050/060/096.  For many of those records, the solution would be to look in the holding record 852 field or to look in OCLC for a call# in the current online version of master record; those remaining records would need the attention of an original cataloger.</P>

<P>Some 050 fields contained an pseudo call# that should be ignored in the mapping.  National Library of Medicine call#s of ‘W1’ indicate merely that the serial is a medical journal, and something more specific would be needed.</P>

<P>Terry asked John to be on the new Digital Library Planning Group, to respond to metadata issues raised by CDL.  This would include being a liaison on metadata issues to ACC. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>3. Discussion of &quot;Bibliographic Control of Web Resources: A Library of Congress Action Plan&quot; by Caroline Miller.</P>

<P>We discussed the action plan (</FONT><A HREF="http://lcweb.loc.gov/catdir/bibcontrol/draftplan.html"><FONT SIZE=2>http://lcweb.loc.gov/catdir/bibcontrol/draftplan.html</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Tahoma" SIZE=3>) through Section 2.3 and planned to finish at another Catalogers Group meeting. Caroline noted that comments on the LC Report are due to them by September 1<SUP>st</SUP>, 2001.</P>

<P>Announcements</P>

<P>John will be on vacation August 31 through September 12. The next Catalogers Group meetings will be held on September 13 and 20.</P>
