            <h1>Original Monographic Cataloging Policy</h1>
            <h3>Definition:</h3>
            <p>Original Monographic Cataloging is defined as the creation of a 
              new record (040: CLU $c CLU) in the OCLC database. (This differs 
              from the way we define it for purposes of collecting local statistics.) 
              These new records may be encoding level K or I for regular original 
              records or may be encoding level blank for BIBCO contributions. 
            </p>
            <h3>General principles:</h3>
            <p>Original cataloging must adhere to stricter qualitative standards 
              than copy cataloging because original records are shared with thousands 
              of other libraries. <br>
              <br>
              In the creation of original records contributed to the OCLC database, 
              national standards always take precedence over local practices. 
              Records already in the Voyager database cannot be used to determine 
              the form of a heading, the choice of a classification number, or 
              to support other cataloging decisions for original records to be 
              entered in the OCLC database. (The Voyager database contains records 
              entered over many years following a variety of local processes and 
              applying different cataloging codes. While the records may have 
              been correct at the time they were brought into Voyager, it has 
              not been possible to make certain that every name, subject or series 
              heading in Voyager has been kept up to date with today&#146;s cataloging 
              standards. Additionally, local practices for the application of 
              classification numbers have changed several times over the years, 
              as have the LC classification schedules themselves. It has not been 
              possible to review and reclassify all earlier titles when a local 
              or national change in classification practice has occurred.)<br>
              <br>
              In the creation of original records contributed to the OCLC database, 
              other records in that database may be used as a model (such as when 
              creating a &#147;new&#148; record from an earlier edition). However, 
              everything in the new record must be verified according to the guidelines 
              below, even if the model record was a DLC record. This is because 
              of continuous changes to authority records, classification schedules, 
              and cataloging rules.<br>
              <br>
              When in doubt, consult your supervisor or Section Head.</p>
            <h3>Guidelines:</h3>
            <p>Immediately prior to entering a new record in OCLC, search the 
              OCLC database one final time to make sure that the record has not 
              already been added by another library. If your record has been in 
              save for a day or longer, you must research it before updating the 
              record and adding it to the OCLC database.<br>
              <br>
              Follow OCLC bibliographic input standards for the encoding level 
              chosen (K, I, blank) (see Bibliographic Formats and Standards Manual 
              for details). If doing PCC cataloging, follow PCC standards for 
              BIBCO full or core cataloging (see <a href="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/pcc/bibco/pccfull.html">PCC 
              Full-level Bibliographic Standards</a> and <a href="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/pcc/bibco/corebook.html">BIBCO 
              Core Record Standards for Books</a> .<br>
              <br>
              If a call number is entered in an 090 or 050 of a new OCLC record, 
              it must follow the most current version of the LC classification 
              schedules, using either Classification Web or the print schedules. 
              Finding a classification number in Voyager is not justification 
              for using that classification number in a new original record, although 
              a Voyager search may be a good first step to narrowing down the 
              possible classification numbers. Finding a classification number 
              in another record in OCLC (even a DLC record) is not justification 
              for using that classification number in a new original record.<br>
              <br>
              Purely local shelving numbers (such as those used for the Music 
              Library CDA collection or for some Special Collections materials) 
              must be entered in 099 fields so that they drop out of the OCLC 
              master records. <i><b>Note</b></i>: <i>In the case of PCC original 
              records, where the national classification is entered in the 050 
              4, our local variation should be entered in the 090 field because 
              it will drop out of the master record when an 050 4 is present.</i><br>
              <br>
              Follow AACR2 and the LCRIs for new cataloging for descriptive cataloging, 
              choice and form of access points, etc. For instance, if you are 
              cloning a new record from a record for an earlier edition, you may 
              need to choose a different main entry, change punctuation in the 
              245, 260, 300 or other fields or change the form and/or coding of 
              notes such as 504 notes or 546 notes. <br>
              <br>
              All access points (1xx, 240, 440, 6xx, 7xx, 8xx) must use the form 
              of the heading established in the national authority file in OCLC. 
              Finding a national-level authority record in the Voyager database 
              is not sufficient. All authority searching for original cataloging 
              must be done in the authority file in OCLC because of the possibility 
              that the headings have changed since the records were loaded into 
              Voyager. If there is no national authority record, establish the 
              heading according to AACR2 and the LCRIs. If there is local variation 
              needed for a series or other entry, enter the heading according 
              to the national standards in the OCLC master record, then make the 
              modifications needed locally before updating the record for ORION.
