    <td colspan="4" class="justify">Donald Ryder Dickey (1887-1932) was able in the course of ten years to build an excellent library of approximately 10,000 volumes, to gather over 50,000 specimens of birds and mammals, and to photograph animals in the wild during his extensive field work in Canada, Laysan Island in the Hawaiian chain, Hawaii, California, and Baja California. More than 7000 photographs in various formats were created. (See the article: “<a href="">An Appreciation of Donald R. Dickey</a>”).<br><br>
The collection contains photographs of birds, mammals, people, and places. Dickey spent a great deal of time in the field. He documented these areas photographically and he kept extensive journals and field notes. He made trips to New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Mexico (primarily Baja California). In the United States he spent a great deal of time in California camping, collecting, and photographing in Amador, El Dorado, Imperial, Inyo, Kern, Los Angeles, Mariposa, Mendocino, Modoc, Mono, Monterey, Orange, Plumas, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Shasta, and Ventura Counties. In 1923 he joined the Tanager Expedition, a Smithsonian sponsored expedition to Laysan Island in the Hawaiian Island Chain as the expedition photographer. Alexander Wetmore, a future Secretary of the Smithsonian, was the leader of the Tanager Expedition. In all of these places he photographically recorded the fauna, and their habitat. For birds he was particularly intent on recording not only habitat but also reproductive behavior, (nests, eggs, brooding, feeding). The collection consists of over 7000 photographs in various formats. The collection is made up of negatives, prints, and lantern slides. The original negatives are on glass and on nitrate film (the nitrate has been copied to safety film). The lantern slides are glass and some have been hand-colored. The positives are most likely on gelatin developing-out paper.
