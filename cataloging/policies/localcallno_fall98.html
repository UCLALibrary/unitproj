    <H3 ALIGN="center">REVIEW AND RECOMMENDATIONS</H3>
    
    <H3 ALIGN="CENTER">(adopted Fall 1998)</H3>
    
      
        <P>The following are situations in which the URL Cataloging Department&#146;s
          classification or cuttering practices currently deviate from national
          practice. Each situation is discussed separately with an assessment of
          the impact on user service and cost to the Library of deviating from
          national practice. Each section concludes with a recommendation to
          continue or discontinue the practice. </P>
        
        <P>Costs to the Library must be weighed against benefits to the user.
          In some cases, local processing costs and the time it takes to make
          materials available to the public increase substantially when UCLA
          practice deviates from national practice. This is because the Library
          is able to use a smaller percentage of nationally-available cataloging
          copy without substantial modification and because extra steps must be
          taken in the records that UCLA contributes to the national databases
          in the form of original records to ensure that they meet both local
          and national standards. In general, following LC classification,
          cuttering practices, and tables allows for more efficient and faster
          processing of library materials and facilitates the sharing of
          information about UCLA&#146;s unique collections with other libraries.</P>
        
        <P>Because the assignment of classification numbers is dispersed among
          many individuals at different stages of the process and because no
          figures are available for the number of titles processed each year in
          each modified classification area, it is impossible to calculate the
          dollar savings that would accrue if URL Cataloging were to follow LC
          classification and cuttering practices more faithfully. All that can
          be said is that it is clear that significant amounts of time could be
          saved and that more materials could be made available more quickly if
          we followed the national standards more consistently. </P>
        
        <P><B>1. Specific requests from client units. These appear on the
          workform through a note.</B></P>
        
        <P>Public service units and/or collection development staff notify
          Cataloging in this way when they wish to keep the new work together
          with a previously cataloged edition or translation or with a locally
          assigned biographical, topical or geographic cutter, or when they wish
          to suggest other exceptional classification treatment. Such requests
          are common practice in libraries throughout the country. Keeping
          different editions of the same work together on the shelves is
          convenient for users and costs the Library only the staff time
          involved in recording the request and keying the local number into a
          bibliographic record. It has little impact on the efficiency of the
          cataloging process because the information is provided up front with
          each individual title, requiring neither special checking nor pulling
          materials out of a particular workflow.</P>
        
        <P>Recommendation: <B>continue</B> to follow the special requests from
          non-cataloging units because it is convenient for users (both public
          and staff), costs the Library little in staff time, and doesn&#146;t
          decrease the efficiency of the cataloging process in any measurable
          way.</P>
        
        <P><B>2. Music scores classed in M. </B> </P>
        
        <P>URL Cataloging currently uses local cutters in selected areas of the
          M schedule, such as ML50 and ML410 classification areas. There are
          some other areas where we employ local cutters because the composers&#146;
          works are so voluminous. Due to the complexity and special nature of
          music materials, music never seems to fit into the normal workflow of
          a general cataloging department. Within URL Cataloging, music scores
          and parts follow a separate path, bypassing the Rapid Cataloging
          Section, and going directly to the Music Mini-Team. Special
          instructions have also been formulated to assist in the binding and
          special processing needed for music materials. In addition, Music
          requires extra authority work to deal with all the composers/uniform
          titles, limiting the ability to process these materials rapidly.
          Another general factor influencing the way music differs from other
          subject areas, is the fact that older materials continue to be
          retained, acquired currently, and utilized heavily. Music tends to be
          issued and reissued over and over again in a multitude of various
          editions. Music Reference Librarians from the Music Library indicate
          that the most heavily browsed portion of their collection is that of
          the ML 410&#146;s (biographies of composers) and the M 1500-1503
          (operas). </P>
        
        <P>Recommendation: <B>continue</B> to use local cutters in selected
          areas of the M classification schedule because it is convenient for
          users, costs the Library no extra staff time, and doesn&#146;t
          decrease the efficiency of the cataloging process in any measurable
          way. </P>
        
        <P><B>3. LC classification numbers reserved or modified for local use,
          such as TR 16 or Z 233 M3 (Special Collections), LD 791.8-791.9 (UCLA
          dissertations), and N 7433.4, Artists' books. See Cataloging Dept.
          Reserved or Modified Call Numbers (Appendix A) for a complete listing
          and explanation. </B></P>
        
        <P>These call numbers fall into several different categories and the
          recommendations follow each category.</P>
        <UL>
          <LI> Call numbers used in place of sublocations or collection names.
            These consist primarily of Special Collections materials, such as
            materials for the Peter Pauper Press Collection which are placed in
            AC5P4 or the Mexican Pamphlet Collection which are placed in
            AC971Z5. These collections use numbers that were not being used by
            the Library of Congress when they were selected and, in most cases,
            still are not used by LC. Using pseudo-LC numbers allows collocation
            of the materials in these collections without interfering with true
            classification numbers assigned for other Library materials. Since
            Special Collections materials already require special processing,
            there is little to be gained in terms of more efficient processing
            by discontinuing this local practice. In fact, the need to assign
            true, unique classification numbers for the materials in these
            collections, rather than the pre-assigned collection numbers, would
            actually slow down the cataloging process. Other methods for
            collocating these collections could be explored (such as defined
            sublocation codes in ORION2), but there seems no point in disrupting
            a practice that adequately serves the special needs of a
            non-browsing collection. <I>Recommendation</I>: <B>continue</B>
            the pseudo-LC call number practice for Special Collections materials
            unless requested to stop by the client unit because it is convenient
            for users and actually speeds up the processing of the materials.
          </LI>
          <LI> Artists&#146; books are another category where Cataloging
            modifies the use of the LC schedules for purposes of collocation of
            a special group of materials. URL Cataloging has classified artists&#146;
            books in N7433.4 and has further used a modified cutter arrangement.
            The Head of the Arts Library prefers to have the artists&#146; books
            collocated in N7433.4 because of their heavy use but prefers that we
            follow the LC cuttering scheme rather than the locally-devised
            cutters in this area. <I>Recommendation</I>: <B>Continue</B> the
            collocation of artists&#146; books in N7433.4 but use LC cutters
            within that number. </LI>
          <LI> Another category of materials that receive pseudo LC
            classification numbers are UCLA publications, primarily
            dissertations. These materials are assigned call numbers in another
            area of the classification schedule not used by the Library of
            Congress. Many libraries follow a similar practice for their local
            dissertations for similar reasons, including: 1) The local
            classification allows collocation of all dissertations by the school
            or department granting the degree; 2) access to dissertations is
            needed very quickly and using pre-determined call numbers for the
            granting department speeds up the cataloging process; and 3)
            dissertations are often on cutting-edge topics that have not yet
            been developed by the Library of Congress and true classification
            numbers often do not yet exist for the subject content of the
            dissertation. Because dissertations require original cataloging in
            99.9% of all cases, there is no rapid workflow that is being
            disrupted by following a locally-devised classification scheme. <I>Recommendation</I>:
            <B>continue </B>local call numbers for UCLA dissertations because
            of the convenience to users and because the practice allows faster
            processing of the materials. </LI>
        </UL>
        
        <P><B>4. Standing requests from individual client units who desire
          local cuttering so that certain areas of their collections (usually
          literary or &quot;author-like&quot; sequences) remain in alphabetical
          order.</B></P>
        
        <P>Specific areas that fall under this category are: photographers
          classed in TR and screenplays classed in PN 1997. Trying to maintain
          local cutters in the TR&#146;s and PN1997 means that many materials
          with otherwise-acceptable cataloging records are pulled out of an
          efficient, rapid workflow merely to require a higher-level staff
          member to assign a local alphabetic cutter based on the Cutter Sanborn
          table. In most cases, the alphabetic cutter assigned by the Library of
          Congress would not disrupt the alphabetic arrangement greatly. Using
          the LC cutter numbers when provided would save significant time and
          would enable cataloging  staff to concentrate, instead, on increasing
          productivity.</P>
        
        <P>Recommendation: <B>discontinue </B>local cuttering for the TR&#146;s
          and PN&#146;s because the disruption to users would be minimal and
          following LC cutters exactly would allow for more efficient
          processing. </P>
        
        <P><B>5. Belles lettres in the P-PZ classification for authors who
          have a single classification or cutter number.</B></P>
        
        <P>Currently, URL Cataloging uses the same base classification number
          for literary authors (belles lettres) as the Library of Congress.
          However, both the primary author cutters and the secondary cutters are
          assigned using a local system. Since most other libraries in the
          country follow the LC system exactly, that means that hundreds of
          thousands of bibliographic records created by the Library of Congress
          and by other academic libraries for belles lettres materials cannot be
          used by UCLA without modification of the call number. </P>
        
        <P>The objection to accepting the Library of Congress cutters for
          literary authors is that it would inconvenience users who would no
          longer be able to browse the stacks effectively and find all works by
          the same literary author physically together on the shelf (loss of
          physical collocation). There are four points to consider regarding
          loss of physical collocation: 1) Many titles for literary authors have
          already been moved to the SRLF. Unless all titles for a given literary
          author are moved to the SRLF, there is already considerable distance
          between some works by that author and others, as they are shelved in
          completely different buildings; 2) Many titles for literary authors
          are shelved in URL and many others are shelved in College or other
          locations. Again, as long as titles for the same literary author are
          not all shelved in the same location, there is already lack of
          physical browsability; 3) The locally-devised system of cuttering  is
          so cumbersome and internally inconsistent that it is often misapplied.
          There are already many errors resulting in the placement of belles
          lettres works outside of the internal alphabetic sequence; 4) Using LC
          classification and cuttering consistently would move most authors only
          slightly in the stacks. For instance, the LC classification for the
          author Gabriel Garcia Marquez is PQ 8180.17 A73, while the local
          variation is PQ 8180.17 G167. If we were to adopt the Library of
          Congress cutters, the base number for an author (in this case, PQ
          8180.17) would remain the same and users would still be in the same
          section of the stacks. In this case, the loss of collocation would
          result in books by the same author being separated by approximately 40
          spaces on the shelf. For more prolific authors or where UCLA had a
          stronger collection from a particular region and time period, the
          books might be separated perhaps by several shelves, although they
          would still be in the same range of shelves. For regions and time
          periods for which UCLA had smaller collections, the books would be
          separated by even fewer than 40 spaces on the shelf. </P>
        
        <P>The arguments in favor of adopting the Library of Congress cutters
          for literary authors are that it would speed up the processing of a
          considerable number of titles and would ultimately save the Library
          money. Most recent figures for items newly received in URL Cataloging
          indicate that approximately 35% of all books coming into the
          department that would ordinarily receive rapid cataloging (done by the
          lowest level staff at a high rate of production) are pulled out of
          that process so that a local call number can be assigned because they
          are belles lettres. The assignment of local call numbers is done by
          higher-level career staff or by professional librarians. Once the
          local call number is assigned, the books are routed back to the
          lower-level staff for completion. Last year, the Department cataloged
          47,000 books using the rapid process. This year&#146;s production is
          expected to be even higher for this category of materials. At least
          16,450 books that could otherwise be processed using rapid cataloging
          procedures will be pulled out of that process only to have local
          cutters assigned. Pulling a book out of the rapid process, assigning a
          local call number, rerouting it, then keying in a special call number
          into the bibliographic record adds a minimum of five minutes to the
          time it takes to process one of these books. In a year, the extra
          effort involved in maintaining this particular local call number
          practice equates to three quarters to one full FTE. In addition, the
          higher-level staff who must supply the local call number are already
          fully occupied with their own work. As a result, these books sit for
          as long as three months waiting for someone to assign the local call
          number. </P>
        
        <P>Recommendation: <B>discontinue</B> the local practice and use the
          Library of Congress classification schedules, cutters and tables for
          belles lettres. There would be some inconvenience to some users, due
          to loss of physical collocation. However, that inconvenience would be
          offset by the fact that they would have access to the cataloged
          materials more quickly and that time currently spent assigning local
          call numbers could instead be spent cataloging additional titles. </P>
        
        <P><B>6. Individual artists and/or their works of art classed in N.
          </B></P>
        
        <P>As with belles lettres, URL Cataloging uses the same base
          classification number for individual artists as the Library of
          Congress. However, both the primary artist cutters and the secondary
          cutters are assigned using a local system. Since most other libraries
          in the country follow the LC system exactly, that means that hundreds
          of thousands of bibliographic records created by the Library of
          Congress and by other academic libraries for art exhibition catalogs
          and books about various artists cannot be used by UCLA without
          modification of the call number.</P>
        
        <P>As with literary authors (belles lettres), there is concern about
          loss of physical collocation for an artist if UCLA began to accept the
          Library of Congress cutters. The same points about collocation need to
          be considered: 1) Some books by or about an artist are already in the
          SRLF and the collection is already split; 2) the existing system has
          been applied inconsistently and artists are already split; 3) loss of
          collocation is even less than with literary authors because the local
          system retains the same letter of the alphabet for the artist&#146;s
          cutter as that used by the Library of Congress. For instance, the LC
          cutter for Michelangelo in the general art area is B9, whereas the
          UCLA cutter for this area is B8. Materials cataloged under the local
          system would not be separated by great spaces on the shelf from those
          cataloged using the Library of Congress system. </P>
        
        <P>4) There is still another point to consider regarding collocation
          for artists catalogs. The classification schedules already separate
          artists who produce works in more than one media into different
          classifications for each medium. For instance, books about the work of
          Michelangelo Buonarroti covering all his media are classified in
          N6923; books about his sculpture are classified in NB623; books about
          his drawing are in NC257; books about his painting are in ND623. There
          is little collocation already for all the works by or about a
          particular artist.</P>
        
        <P>Statistics have never been kept for the number of these artists
          books cataloged each year. However, as with belles lettres, pulling a
          book out of the rapid process, assigning a local call number,
          rerouting it, then keying a special call number into the bibliographic
          record to replace the one that was already there adds a minimum of
          five minutes to the time it takes to process one of these books.
          Because assigning local call numbers is dispersed through several
          levels of staff and many individuals, the savings associated with
          discontinuing local deviations from LC classification would be
          realized primarily through increased efficiency of the total process.</P>
        
        <P>Recommendation: <B>discontinue</B> the local practice and use the
          Library of Congress classification schedules for books for individual
          artists. There would be minor inconvenience to some users. However,
          that inconvenience would be offset by the fact that they would have
          access to the cataloged materials more quickly and that time currently
          spent assigning local call numbers could instead be spent cataloging
          additional titles. </P>
