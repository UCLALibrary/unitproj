    <H3>LITERATURE CUTTERING SCHEMES</H3>
    
    <P>In each section of the &quot;P&quot; schedules for the literature of
      special languages or countries there are classes within period
      subdivisions for individual authors and their works in all literary forms.
      Follow instructions in each classification schedule carefully.
      <A NAME="PA"></A></P>
    
    <H4><B>PA (Latin and Greek)</B></H4>
    
    <H5>Classical:</H5>
    
    <P>Follow the instructions in the classification schedule; however, always
      adjust to local practice where necessary. In the past, translations under
      some authors were arranged by a language table in the PA schedule that has
      been superseded. The table used a letter plus up to three Arabic numerals
      (e.g., French: F5-7). UCLA used the table, but substituted the following
      instructions:</P>
    <UL>
      <LI> 1st numeral: translations of collected works, subarranged by date
        (e.g., F5). </LI>
      <LI> 2nd numeral: translations of selections, subarranged by date (F6).
      </LI>
      <LI> 3rd numerals: translations of individual titles, with double cutter
        from title, subarranged by date (F7). </LI>
    </UL>
    
    <P>Continue to use this if already established under an author.</P>
    
    <H5>Medieval and Modern:</H5>
    
    <P>If the author has been established in the shelflist, follow what has
      been used for that author. When establishing a new author, cutter to
      maintain alphabetical sequence and use scheme for <CITE>PQ &amp; PT.</CITE></P>
